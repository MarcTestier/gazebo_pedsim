# WORK IN PROGRESS
# Gazebo PedSim

This repo is in development and currently uses ROS Melodic and Gazebo 9.

The repo contains 4 folders:
- pedsim, the original PedSim sources, adapted to compile using catkin,
- pedsim_ros_plugin, the Gazebo plugin for pedsim,
- pedsim_test, some test using ROS and the *pedsim* folder above,
- utilities, some useful functions to create spawn points and waypoints.
